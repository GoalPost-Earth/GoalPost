# GoalPost Prototype 1

## Installation Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the GoalPost prototype on your local machine. 

The prototype is built using Next.js, Neo4j, and Auth0, and it includes optional AI features powered by OpenAI.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up GoalPost, make sure you have:

1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. Git
3. Free accounts with:
   - [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup)
   - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) (if using optional AI features)
   - [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdamashek/GoalPost.git
cd GoalPost
npm install
```

### Step 2: Set Up Neo4j Aura Free

1. Create a Neo4j Aura account and log in
2. Create a new free database
3. When the database is ready, find and note your:
   - Database URI (e.g., `neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`)
   - Username (default: `neo4j`)
   - Password (generated by Aura)

### Step 3: Configure Auth0

1. Create a new Auth0 application:
   - Go to the Auth0 Dashboard and create a new Application
   - Select "Regular Web Applications"
   - In Settings, add the following URLs to "Allowed Callback URLs", "Allowed Logout URLs", and "Allowed Web Origins":
     - `http://localhost:3000`
     - Your production URL (if applicable)

2. Set up the Auth0 API:
   - Go to "APIs" in Auth0 Dashboard
   - Create a new API (e.g., "GoalPost API")
   - Set the identifier to `https://goalpost.app` (or your custom domain)

3. Note your Auth0 credentials:
   - Domain
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - API Audience (the identifier you set in the previous step)

### Step 4: Set Up OpenAI API (If Using Optional AI Features)

1. Create or log in to your OpenAI account
2. Navigate to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3. Create a new API key and note it

### Step 5: Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root directory (use the `.env.example` file as a template).

To generate a random AUTH0_SECRET, you can use a secure generator.

For the JWT_SECRET, paste your Auth0 certificate. You can get this from Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Your App > Advanced Settings > Certificates. Make sure to replace the line breaks with the '\n' character so that you can paste it as a single line string while preserving the line breaks.

### Step 6: Initialize the Database

Run the initialization script to populate your Neo4j database if you want to use the seed data:

```bash
npm run init:db
```

### Step 7: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

### Step 8 (Optional): Deploy to Vercel

If you want to deploy your application to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create a Vercel account and log in
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure the environment variables in your Vercel project settings
4. Deploy your application

### Enabling AI
To enable AI features, make sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` file. There is a toggle in the sidebar that will enable or disable the AI features. The AI features are currently in development and may not be fully functional.

*### NOTE: The prototype is a work in progress and may not include all features or be fully functional. It is intended for demonstration purposes only. Please report any issues or suggestions to the repository's issue tracker.*

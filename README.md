# GoalPost Prototype 1-5

Looking for docs? Start with the consolidated index at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for architecture, setup, and assistant mode references.

## Installation Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the GoalPost prototype on your local machine. 

The prototype is built using Next.js, Neo4j, and includes optional AI features powered by OpenAI.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up GoalPost, make sure you have:

1. Node.js (v18 or higher)
2. Git
3. Free accounts with:
   - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) (if using optional AI features)
   - [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/)
   - [Resend](https://resend.com/signup) (for email functionality)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdamashek/GoalPost.git
cd GoalPost
npm install
```

### Step 2: Set Up Neo4j Aura Free

1. Create a Neo4j Aura account and log in
2. Create a new free database
3. When the database is ready, find and note your:
   - Database URI (e.g., `neo4j+s://xxxxxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`)
   - Username (default: `neo4j`)
   - Password (generated by Aura)

### Step 3: Set Up OpenAI API (If Using Optional AI Features)

1. Create or log in to your OpenAI account
2. Navigate to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3. Create a new API key and note it

### Step 4: Set Up Resend for Email Functionality

1. Create or log in to your Resend account at https://resend.com/
2. Navigate to the API Keys section in your dashboard
3. Create a new API key and note it

### Step 5: Create Environment File

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root directory (use the `.env.example` file as a template).

#### How to get required secrets and variables:

- **JWT_SECRET**: Used for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
  - For local development, generate a strong random string:
    ```bash
    openssl rand -base64 64
    ```
    Copy the output and use it as your `JWT_SECRET` in `.env.local`.
  - For production, ensure you use a cryptographically secure random string.

- **PEPPER**: Generate a random string (at least 32 characters). You can use `openssl rand -base64 32` or an online password generator. Example:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
  Copy the output and use it as the value for `PEPPER` in your `.env.local`.

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_FROM**: Set this to the email sender you want for transactional emails. Example:
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAIL_FROM="Goalpost <info@goalpost.earth>"
  ```

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL**: Set this to your local or production base URL. For local development, use:
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
  ```

- **RESEND_API_KEY**: Required for sending transactional emails via the Resend email service. To obtain a key:
  1. Go to https://resend.com/ and sign up or log in.
  2. Navigate to the API Keys section in your Resend dashboard.
  3. Create a new API key and copy it.
  4. Add it to your `.env.local` as:
     ```env
     RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
     ```

### Step 6: Initialize the Database

Run the initialization script to populate your Neo4j database if you want to use the seed data:

```bash
npm run init:db
```

### Step 7: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Authentication

The application uses a custom JWT-based authentication system with the following features:

- User registration and login
- Password reset functionality via email
- JWT token-based session management
- Automatic token refresh
- Secure logout

Users can sign up with an email and password, and the system handles password hashing, token generation, and email verification for password resets.

### Step 8 (Optional): Deploy to Vercel

If you want to deploy your application to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Create a Vercel account and log in
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Configure the environment variables in your Vercel project settings
4. Deploy your application

### Enabling AI
To enable AI features, make sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` file. There is a toggle in the sidebar that will enable or disable the AI features. The AI features are currently in development and may not be fully functional.

*### NOTE: The prototype is a work in progress and may not include all features or be fully functional. It is intended for demonstration purposes only. Please report any issues or suggestions to the repository's issue tracker.*

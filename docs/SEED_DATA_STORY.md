## The Story Arc

### Phase 1: Doubt & Uncertainty (P60D - P30D)
- Robert: "Will we hit our target timeline? The pressure is real"
- JD: "Open source LLMs vs proprietary - which path serves users best?"
- Jesse: "How do we make resonance discovery feel intuitive, not overwhelming?"
- Jennifer: "The MeSpace alone delivers immense value - maybe that's our MVP"

### Phase 2: Decisions & Progress (P30D - P10D)
- JD: "OpenAI's API gives us speed and reliability for launch"
- Jennifer: "Prototype should focus on MeSpace if we can't do everything"
- Jesse: "Finding the right balance between information and simplicity"
- Robert: "Compliance and privacy are non-negotiable"

### Phase 3: Momentum & Clarity (P10D - P5D)
- Robert: "The team is pulling together - we might actually make it"
- Jesse: "The UX is clicking - users will love this flow"
- JD: "Not worried about timeline - the work is solid and progressing"
- Dev Team: "JD and I are in flow - handoffs are seamless"

### Phase 4: Triumph (P2D - P1D)
- JD: "We actually did it - the system works beautifully"
- Jesse: "Users are calling the UX 'intuitive and delightful'"
- Jennifer: "This team turned doubt into triumph through trust and collaboration"
- Robert: "Ship GoalPost v1 with complete MeSpace + resonance system" ✓ COMPLETED

## Discovered Resonances

The AI system discovered 5 key patterns:

1. **Timeline Anxiety** (0.89 confidence)
   - Robert's journey from "Will we hit our target?" to "The team is pulling together"
   
2. **Technical Clarity** (0.85-0.87 confidence)
   - JD's LLM decision-making process and growing confidence
   
3. **UX Clarity** (0.91-0.93 confidence)
   - Jesse's design journey from complexity to intuitive simplicity
   
4. **Strategic Focus** (0.88-0.90 confidence)
   - Jennifer's MeSpace-first insight + Robert's recognition of its brilliance
   
5. **Triumph** (0.92-0.95 confidence)
   - Team-wide celebration of successful launch and collaboration

## Conversation Deepening Examples

The seed includes 3 conversation chunks showing how the system guides users to explore their thoughts:

### JD's LLM Strategy
- User: "I'm weighing open source LLMs versus proprietary models"
- Assistant: "What factors are most important in this decision?"
- User: "Cost, privacy, reliability, and speed to launch..."
- User: "For launch, OpenAI's API means we can focus on our unique value"

### Jesse's UX Clarity
- User: "How do we make resonance discovery feel intuitive?"
- Assistant: "What feels overwhelming about the current approach?"
- User: "There's so much data - pulses, contexts, resonances..."
- User: "I think animation can guide attention. Show connections forming, not all at once."

### Robert's Timeline Anxiety
- User: "Will we hit our target timeline?"
- Assistant: "What's causing the most concern?"
- User: "So much depends on this launch. The pressure feels intense."
- User: "I worry we've set expectations that we might not meet."

## Statistics

The seed data creates:
- **4 Persons** (Robert, Jennifer, JD, Jesse)
- **1 Community** (GoalPost Core Team)
- **7 Spaces** (4 MeSpaces + 3 WeSpaces)
- **13 FieldContexts** with emergent names
- **29 FieldPulses** (Goals, Stories, Resources) spanning 60 days
- **5 FieldResonances** (AI-discovered patterns)
- **10 ResonanceLinks** (explainable connections with evidence)
- **12 ConversationChunks** (3 deepening conversations)

## Usage

Run the seed data:
```bash
npm run setup:env
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm run init:db
```

The data demonstrates:
- Personal growth tracking (MeSpaces)
- Team collaboration (WeSpaces)
- AI-driven resonance discovery
- Conversation deepening with context
- Human-in-the-loop review workflow
- Complete journey from doubt to triumph

## What Makes This Powerful

This seed data showcases GoalPost's core value propositions:

1. **Authentic Personal Journeys**: Each team member's MeSpace captures their real concerns, decisions, and growth
2. **Collaborative Resonance**: WeSpaces show how individual insights connect in team contexts
3. **AI-Driven Discovery**: The resonance system found patterns the team might not have noticed
4. **Explainability**: Every AI-discovered connection includes evidence and confidence scores
5. **Privacy-First**: MeSpaces are private; WeSpaces are shared only with members
6. **Emergent Understanding**: Context names like "The Clock" and "Choosing The Path" emerge from the content

## Next Steps

With this seed data loaded, you can:
1. Explore the graph structure in Neo4j Browser
2. Test semantic search across pulses and chunks
3. Review AI-discovered resonance links
4. Generate new pulses and watch resonances emerge
5. Experience conversation deepening in action

Can you generate test data in csv format? I will give you the headings for each entity type and then you can send back the data.

Use these rules:

• Nodes: Represent entities like Person, Community, Goal, Resource, Core Value, Care Point.
• Attributes: Each node contains relevant properties, such as availability for resources and success metrics for goals.
* The data should be meaningful and realistic and should reflect a community of care for people who care deeply about their environment and also about enriching data.
* Encapsulate each cell with double quotes
* Replace all images with avatars from https://api.dicebear.com/9.x/lorelei/svg?seed=Jane
* Use the following seed for the avatar: "firstName lastName"
* Person ids should be picked form 101-108
* Care Point is a node that represent an intersection of goals to goals and resources. It is a representation of care given and received and a means of quantifying and measuring such care

You are to generate as many of such  carepoint nodes as make sense
Use this as insipration for the test data. The first row is the headings and the second row everything else is sample data.
